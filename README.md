skins are mostly done but may make some tweaks, may be missing some things or have things that don't actually do anything.. the dark blue is a placeholder to make it stand out to see where it needs to be changed.  some things like git/ai mode stuff might be off scheme-wise as i've not tested them extensively. 
<br/> comments are what i could make of them visually, any //? are ones i did not notice any direct change or did not find what it changed.  //self indicates the name of the field is self explanitory.
