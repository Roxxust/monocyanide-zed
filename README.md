skin is still being tweaked as needed, may be missing some things or have things that don't actually do anything..  some things like git/ai mode stuff might be off as i've not tested them extensively. may need to do a settings.json override for the accents to work properly in current versions.. <br/> comments are what i could make of them visually, any //? are ones i did not notice any direct change or did not find what it changed.  //self indicates the name of the field is self explanitory.
